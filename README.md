# Mathematical-Modelling-of-Roller-Coaster

## Problem Statement:
Your city wants to setup a roller-coaster that is stretched all around the city. Design a MM
answering questions like cost of setup and maintenance, ticket price, energy requirements,
effect on happiness of the people etc.

## MAIN ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
As mentioned in the question. It is mentioned that we need to design a roller coaster “stretching” across the city . It is not mentioned whether the entire track has to loop around the city or whether we plan to build multiple roller coaster tracks
stretching around the city. So for our modelling we assume that we build a roller coaster which covers approx. … area . And to in order to fulfil the criteria of “stretching across the city “ we ensure that we have
multiple roller coaster / amusement parks across the city.Though Roller coaster are of several types and has several features, we assume that our roller coaster is a traditional “sit-down” roller coaster. 

## The Model Curve

### Average slope of the curve = H/R { where H , R are considered with sign }
