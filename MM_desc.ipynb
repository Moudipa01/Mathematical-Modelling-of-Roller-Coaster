    "Roller coaster elements are the individual parts of roller coaster design and operation,\n",
    "such as a track, hill, loop, or turn.\n",
    "Variations in normal track movement that add thrill or excitement to the ride are often\n",
    "called \"thrill elements\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch Track - A launch track is a section of a launched roller coaster in which\n",
    "the train is accelerated to its full speed in a matter of seconds. A launch track is always\n",
    "straight and is usually banked upward slightly, so that a train would roll backward to the\n",
    "station in the event of a loss of power\n",
    "For example,the Ferrari Rossa uses a hydraulic launch system which propels the roller\n",
    "coaster to a speed of 240 km/hr in just 250 m\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift Hill - A lift hill, or chain lift, is often the initial upward section of track on a typical\n",
    "roller coaster that initially transports the roller coaster train to an elevated point. Upon\n",
    "reaching the top, the train is then disengaged from the lift hill and allowed to coast\n",
    "through the rest of the roller coaster's circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Station - The station is the area where guests waiting in a line queue board a roller\n",
    "coaster. The line often divides into lanes to allow guests to board each row. In addition to\n",
    "boarding, passengers also exit the ride within the station, but this is not always at the\n",
    "same location where boarding passengers are waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banked turn - A banked turn is when the track twists from the horizontal plane\n",
    "into the vertical plane, tipping the train to the side in the direction of the turn. Banking is\n",
    "used to minimize the lateral G-forces on the riders to make the turn more comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Braker Run - A brake run on a roller coaster is any section of track meant to slow or\n",
    "stop a roller coaster train. Brake runs may be located anywhere or hidden along the\n",
    "circuit of a coaster and may be designed to bring the train to a complete halt or to simply\n",
    "adjust the train's speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head Chopper - A head chopper is any point on a roller coaster where the support\n",
    "structure of the ride or the track itself comes very close to the passengers' heads, or at\n",
    "least appears to do so.\n",
    "All head choppers are, of course, designed so that even the tallest rider, with both hands\n",
    "up, would be unable to touch the structure; although if a rider exceeding the maximum\n",
    "height does board the coaster it could be potentially dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helix- A helix is a balanced spiral, generally exceeding 360°. Helixes can spiral\n",
    "upward or downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunnels - Some roller coasters feature tunnels, and they may include special effects\n",
    "such as lighting, fog, and sound. The Iron Rattler at Six Flags Fiesta Texas, for example,\n",
    "features a darkened, above-ground tunnel. \n"
